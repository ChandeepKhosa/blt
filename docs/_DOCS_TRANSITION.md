Documentation files in this directory are currently in the process of being synchronized with their counterparts on docs.acquia.com. Apologies for the temporary inconvenience.

Previously, the source files for all BLT documentation were written in Markdown. Going forward, they will be written in RST. The _technical contents_ of the original Markdown documentation are in the process of being merged into the RST documentation. As these files are reviewed and merged, they will be removed one-by-one until only the fully updated RST versions remain.

During this interim period, all of the original Markdown documentation lives in the `_markdown` directory and generally has the most up-to-date technical information (ahead of what’s on docs.acquia.com.)

The RST files in the present directory (`docs`) should mirror what’s available on docs.acquia.com, but may be slightly out-of-date with the latest BLT features and best practices until the transition is complete.
